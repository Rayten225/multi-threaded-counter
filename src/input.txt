Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language. Go is designed at Google.
Go is syntactically similar to C but with memory safety, garbage collection,
structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
Concurrency is not parallelism. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
